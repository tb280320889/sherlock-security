Education
---------

　I was a college dropout. In my opinion, I could hardly receive any valuable knowlege that can support me to get a little bit ideal job to live in abundance, the books and technologies there are totally outdated, we could never image what's going on in the world after 4 or more years in your life. As studying from the Internet learning those things that i am truly interested in is much more timesaving and convenient, also that there are many other advantages  such as avoiding picking up bad habits and sasving a lot of money. Life is short, so even there still were some struggling and unsure years after my dropping out, I can now live on my own hands and skills to get a better life, much better than average. So I will never regret making that decision .Nowadays more and more people start to realise that there are much more choices in front of these young generations, that's a great news and the inevitable trending. Fight for your life and god will indicate directions and open doors for you.
